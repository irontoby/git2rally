git2rally - Rally Connector for Git VCS
=========

I downloaded this from <https://help.rallydev.com/git-installation-user-guide> at version "git2rally-gemconn-1.1.0-cib1012.zip". According to the LICENSE file, redistribution of the source code is permitted, but they didn't have it hosted at [their official GitHub account](https://github.com/RallyTools) so I uploaded it here instead in order to work with it.

Maybe @RallyDev will upload an official version?
