In Subversion, a committer is identified by a single string value, eg., 'devdanny'.

In Mercurial, a commiter is customarily identified by a two part identifier specified by
the username entry in the user's $HOME/.hgrc file (or repository .hgrc/hg file).
The usual convention is that the two parts are the user's name and their email address.

For the purposes of reflecting VCS revisions/changesets in Rally, there is not always
a direct one-to-one mapping between the value of the committer in the VCS and a Rally User.
A Rally User is uniquely identified by the Rally UserName field value.  The VCS connector
has several methods available to enable the mapping of a VCS committer value to a 
Rally User.  In the event that no mapping is found for a VCS committer identifier
a Changeset will still be created in Rally, but there will be no value for the Author 
attribute in the Changeset.

The following is a table consisting of the mapping techniques that take a
Version Control System (VCS) committer identifier and attempt to map it to the 
corresponding Rally UserName value.

VCS user name can be deconstructed                  RallyLookup                            ralkup.rb
 to specific components that have
 counterparts as fields in the Rally 
 User record (FirstName,LastName).
 Lookup occurs on those Rally fields
 to identify a specific Rally User.

VCS user name can usually be                       UserLookupChainGang                     chainlkup.rb
 deconstructed to specific components
 that have counterparts as fields in the
 Rally User record (FirstName,LastName),
 but not always. The non-hits using
 the RallyLookup technique are listed
 in a text file with the intended
 mapping to a Rally UserName.                      UserLookupChainGang(FirstName,LastName,user_map.txt,":")
    (Mercurial oriented)

   Ferris Bueller "ferrister@odos.com"
     -->  ferrisb@odometers.com

   Paula Bisping "paulab@southern-cross.com"
     -->  paulajbi@southernc.com

   where the Rally account for ferrisb@odometers.com
    has the value of 'Ferris' in the FirstName field
    and the value of 'Bueller' in the LastName field.

   the account for paulajbi@southerc.com has no entry
    in either the FirstName or LastName field, but there
    is an entry in the others_map.txt file with:
     Paula Bisping : paulajbi@southernc.com
  
   the sequence is to attempt a lookup match using the
   RallyLookup technique using the committer's name field
   against a lookup list constructed from the concatenation
   of a Rally account's FirstName and LastName field (with 
   a space separating the two values). If there is a match
   of the committer name to a concatenation, then the
   Author attribute of the Changeset created in Rally is
   attributed to the Rally User with the matching concatenation.
   If no such match is found, the lookup list from the file
   named (in the example above, others_map.txt) is consulted
   for a potential match with the commmitters name.
   In the lookup file, the committer name is to the left of
   a separator characters (commonly a ':' character) and
   a valid Rally UserName value is on the right hand side.
